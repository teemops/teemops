**What is the specific feature you would like?**
A 1 liner that describes the feature you would like to see added to the core product. e.g. "Add ability to check for expired IAM User passwords."

**What would you like to see it do?**
A more detailed break down of how this should behave in the UI and/or API.
e.g. "When I start a new audit in Teemops I would like the IAM user passwords to be scanned. If a user has an IAM password expired it should show up as a risk in the insights"

**What area of the system does this impact? Optional**
UI/API/CLI
[can be updated by core team member]
